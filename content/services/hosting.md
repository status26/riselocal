#### Most Common Questions
Q) What Does Good Hosting Matter?
A) Good web hosting means your website doesn't come down from the internet. Most business owners buy hosting because of convenience or price. There is an unseen force behind your precious online assets. Like electrical power, the temptation is to take hosting for granted, but the lights don't always come back on when you flip the switch after an outage.
When considering hosting we recommend focusing on security, maintenance, uptime, bandwith, site load speed and most importantly things like technical expertise and customer service. If the people answering the phone don't have access to restore or change your service you have a problem.

Q) Why is Site Speed So Important?
A) Site speed not only affects conversions, but even serves as a factor that Google may use to rank your site higher than your competitors. Page speed is only one of many algorithmic factors and affects rankings queries.

Q) Where Will My Website be Hosted?
A) Hosting your site locally has significant advantages to your online presence. The geolocation of your website is an important factor in web hosting as shorter distances contribute to faster speeds. Although there are numerous factors, the geographic location of the data center is one of the most significant factors that will affect how fast your website is transferred to the visitor’s computer. When visitors are located geographically closer to your hosting company’s data center, your website will load faster.

Q) What is the difference between Hostgator/Godaddy and Rise Local hosting?
A) The worst thing hosting provider can do is change your IP without notice. The next thing they do that is really troublesome is that they can take 32 hours to reboot a server. Customer service people have no authority and can't fix anything without escalation to a different department. Another thing that concerns us about cheap web hosts is they do not do anything to improve the files that are on the server. When we migrate a site we compress images, minimize java script and focus on TTFB (time to first byte) and loadspeed. All these things are not considered by your standard cheap web hosting providers. Lastly, we have control. Having control means you can optimize code and content quickly. That means alot to your business.

Q) How Long Does It Take to Migrate My Site?
A) Migrations take 3-5 days to complete once the request is submitted. Please make sure you have all your proper credentials. It takes more time to get proper access in many occasions than it does to prepare your site for migration.

Q) Why Choose Rise Local?
A) Rise Local has decades of experience helping thousands of business owners optimize their online presence and potential.

Q) How Long is the Hosting agreement?
A) Your product subscription will be renewed automatically at the end of each subscription period and your chosen payment method will be debited at the full rate unless you cancel your product subscription from within your account settings prior to the renewal date.
